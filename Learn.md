In a cyclic and iterative development method learn phase varies depending on the maturity of the API product. In Protyping phase the API Consumers are different to when the API is in production.
Learning can be achieved by gathering feedback or by interviewing API consumers and studying the analytics reports.

## Prototyping and Building just enough
Gather requirements from your first pilot consumers and API Developers. Analytics and API Management tool gives indication of possible problems needing attention either in API documentation or in the actual Implementation.

## Production
Gather feedback from all API Consumers and API developers. Analyse the API usage and adjust you metrics to see new registrations by developers and how the amount of request develops. Consider the [API Lifecycle](../apilifecycle), publish, deprecate and make plans to retire the old versions of APIs.

Gather new requirements and ideas to the API canvas and start a new round of OPIOps&reg; cycles.
